            Hello and welcome!<br>I’m excited to share my portfolio with you. Here, you’ll discover my work, my skills, and projects that showcase my passion for creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            I bring a strong sense of creativity and visual detail into every project I build. My experience in customer service has also shaped the way I approach development—always focused on solving problems and creating seamless experiences for people.<br>
        <br>
            As I continue growing as a front-end developer, my goal is to combine design, functionality, and performance to deliver meaningful digital solutions. Feel free to explore my portfolio, and get to know the work I enjoy creating.
