        <h2>Erik Rincón Gutiérrez</h2>
        <h3>Personal</h3>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies and staying updated with the latest trends in web development. I also love photography, which allows me to express my creativity and capture moments from unique perspectives.<br>When I'm not coding or behind the camera, you can find me hiking in nature, as it helps me recharge and find inspiration for my projects.</p>
        <p>Overall, I believe that a balanced life is essential for personal growth and professional success. By pursuing my passions and continuously learning, I strive to become a well-rounded individual both in and out of the tech world.</p>
        <p>But not only that, I also like to do exercise and practice calisthenics, which helps me stay active and healthy.
